## What is LinguaVox?

LinguaVox is a Chrome extension that removes the language tax from your daily work. Speak naturally in your native language — LinguaVox transcribes via OpenAI Whisper, translates to any of 21+ target languages, and inserts polished text directly into whatever web field you're typing in. No copy-paste, no app switching, no grammar anxiety.

Works in Gmail, Slack, Notion, Jira, Asana, Salesforce — any website with a text field. Free tier includes 20 requests/day with zero setup. Power users and teams can bring their own OpenAI key for unlimited usage.

**v3.0 — Meeting Mode:** real-time translated subtitles for Google Meet, Zoom, Teams, and any other browser-based call. Tab audio captured via Chrome API → streamed to Deepgram → subtitles appear as a floating overlay. Requires explicit consent on first use.

## How It Works

**Before LinguaVox:** open a separate app → record → copy → switch to browser → paste  
**After LinguaVox:**

```
1. Click any web field (Slack, Gmail, Notion, Jira…)
2. Hold  Ctrl+Space  →  speak
3. Release  →  text appears within ~3 seconds  ✓
```

No copy-paste. No switching apps. Works on any website.

## Browser & OS Requirements

| Browser | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Chrome 88+ | ✅ | Fully supported |
| Edge (Chromium) | ✅ | Should work — same Chromium APIs, not officially tested |
| Brave | ✅ | Should work — not officially tested |
| Opera | ✅ | Should work — not officially tested |
| Firefox | ❌ | Not supported — different extension API |

**OS:** Windows, macOS, Linux — anywhere Chrome/Edge/Brave runs.  
**Google Account required** — free tier login uses Google OAuth. No Google account = no free tier (BYOK still works without Google sign-in is not yet supported).

## Where It Works

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Slack (browser) | ✅ | Browser-level hotkey bypass for Slack's key capture |
| Gmail | ✅ | Compose and reply fields |
| Notion | ✅ | All `contenteditable` blocks |
| Jira | ✅ | Issue fields, comments, descriptions |
| Asana | ✅ | Task and comment fields |
| Salesforce | ✅ | CRM input fields |
| Any `<input>` / `<textarea>` | ✅ | Universal — any website |
| Any `contenteditable` | ✅ | React, Draft.js, Quill compatible |
| Google Docs | ⚠️ | Limited — custom canvas editor |


All OpenAI API calls go through the Worker. API keys never leave the server.

## Key Features

- **No API key required** — 20 req/day free via shared pool, zero setup
- **Bring Your Own Key** — unlimited usage at OpenAI cost (~$0.50/month typical)
- **Organization accounts** — shared key pool, member management, usage analytics
- **21+ languages** — transcription + translation in one step
- **6 AI enhancement modes** — grammar fix, business style, academic, casual, creative, smart polish
- **Meeting Mode** — real-time subtitles for any tab audio (Google Meet, Zoom, Teams…) via Deepgram
- **Privacy-first** — voice audio never stored; meeting audio uses 90s ephemeral tokens, mip_opt_out=true
- **Under 3 seconds** — end-to-end from speech to inserted text
- **95%+ accuracy** — OpenAI Whisper large-v2 equivalent

## AI Enhancement Modes

## Pricing

| Organization | Unlimited | Google Account + shared team API key |

## FAQ

### Does LinguaVox work on Slack?
Yes. Slack intercepts keyboard events at the page level. LinguaVox registers the hotkey at the browser level via `chrome.commands.onCommand`, bypassing Slack's capture. Works in all Slack message fields.

### Do I need an OpenAI API key?
No. Free users get 20 requests/day from the shared pool. Add your own key in the dashboard for unlimited usage.

### Is my voice recorded or stored?
No. Audio is processed in real-time by Whisper and discarded immediately. Zero voice data retained anywhere.

### What languages are supported?
21+ languages: English, Ukrainian, Russian, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Dutch, Turkish, Swedish, Romanian, Greek, Tagalog, Urdu, Punjabi, and more.
